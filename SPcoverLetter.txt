I was looking for a creative and original way of writing this cover letter.
Once I've decided a bash script could be a really cool idea I needed to learn how to use it first...

So, you would like to know what excites me about testing:
- Looking through the patterns
- Proving the code has vulnerabilities
- Bypassing the criteria/logic written by the developer
- Manipulating the backend data or the system set up and seeing the effects in the UI which means 
  I have to use the shell and that's awesome!!!

What is it I am interested in:
- Studying the client's risks in their business scenarios 
- Recreating the problem and finding a solution to make sure it doesn't happen again
- I would love to learn all the great tools and skills Penetration testers/hackers use to break in (and of course Kali!)
